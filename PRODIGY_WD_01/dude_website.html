            The YouTube channel <strong>Where's My Challenge"</strong> was initially started by <strong>'Matt'</strong>
            and <strong>'Paul'</strong> on 15th of April in
            2010 and then the team was quickly expanded to 4 people- <strong><em>Matt, Paul, Harry </em></strong>and
            <strong><em> Lewis.</em></strong> The channel has
            amassed a total of more than 150 million views across Social media platforms, getting more than 98 million
            views on YouTube alone. The channel is based in UK. This channel used to feature extreme challenges mainly
            revolving around food but not limited to it. There was something very special vibe about the channel that
            attracted viewers in a way that other channels failed to. The friendly banter, or the different extreme
            challenges God knows but if at that time if you wanted to see food-challenges ‘DWMW’ is where you went.

            What happened?
        </p>

        <p>
            Well until late 2016 everything was going fine for the <strong>DWMC</strong> guys. They were living the
            dream of their life as they described it. But in the start of 2017, the great <a style="color:#5ea3c8"
                href="https://youtube.fandom.com/wiki/YouTube_Adpocalypse">YouTube Adpocalypse</a> happened. In February
            2017, <strong>PewDiePie</strong>, the most subscribed YouTuber at the time, came under fire for posting
            videos that YouTube deemed "Anti-Semitic" and "hate-speech". Other extremist content was also surfacing, that lead
            the UK Government, Coca-Cola, Dr. Pepper, Johnson & Johnson, and many major brands to pull their adverts from YouTube. This resulted in a lot of Content-Creators losing as much as 90% of the
            revenue and among those content-creators <strong>DWMC</strong> was also present. The channel lost as much as 95% of the ad-revenue overnight. Adding to the problem,
            about 60-70 strikes were made against the channel by some media-company resulting in the deletion of channel
            not once but twice. As if that wasn't enough, one of the guys from the team- <strong><em>Paul</em></strong>
            got terribly sick. He got infected from a bowel disease known as <a style="color:#5ea3c8"
                href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353304#:~:text=Crohn's%20disease%20is%20a%20type,digestive%20tract%20in%20different%20people.">Crohn’s
                disease</a> and had a near death experience.

                Where are they now?
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Paul married love of his life, Stephanie Parker on June 18, 2016. Now Paul has been blessed with three kids.
            Lewis left the group a little while after the Adpocalypse hit. Since then he has a full-time job. Though he
            regularly recordes podcasts with Matt on the channel <a style="color:#5ea3c8"
                href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheThreeskinsPodcast">ThreeSkinsPodcast</a>, he remains absent on the
            main channel to this date. Matt is currently single and still spending his life in his own weird, funky,
            funny way. Harry too has a full-time job. But once a while these old men do put up videos on the main
            channel.
